### Implementation

This is a very early version and some simplifications were made to implement it. Contributions and comments are welcome,
especially when it comes to lighting and blending the effect inside the `THREE.MeshPhysicalMaterial`.

ParallaxMaterial extends [THREE.MeshPhysicalMaterial](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/MeshPhysicalMaterial).
This means that it inherits the same constructor, properties, and methods, while also introducing additional features described below.
The material can have significant impact on performance, but I'm looking into simplifying the glints and releasing a performance version.

Three.js implementation of [Procedural Physically based BRDF for Real-Time Rendering of Glints](http://igg.unistra.fr/People/chermain/real_time_glint/).

### Dictionary

The material is currently provided with 1 base dictionary for glints and can have a significant effect on performance.

## Constructor

Instead of one set of parameters, you provide two - one for [THREE.MeshPhysicalMaterial](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/MeshPhysicalMaterial) and one for `MeshParallaxMaterial`

```ts
new MeshParallaxMaterial(
  MeshPhysicalMaterialParameters,
  MeshGlintMaterialProps
);
```
