## Spritesheet format

Each instanced mesh has to be provided with a spritesheet formatted like this. The library provides utilities to parse aseprite json metadata and to generate it from a image file, but you can (should?) write your own


```ts
type SpritesheetFormat = {
  frames: [x: number, y: number, width: number, height: number][];
  animations: Record<string, [frameId: number, duration: number][]>;
  sheetSize: [width: number, height: number][];
  animationLengths: number[];
};
```

- `frames`: each frame of the spritesheet has its cooridnates and size specified separately - this will allow for non-uniform sized frames
- `animations`: `Map` of named animations. Each animation is defined by an array of frames it consists of (frameId is the index of a frame in `frames`)
- `sheetSize` - size of an image
- `animationLengths` - util, how many frames does each animation have
